# Gastrointestinal_Classification_Project
In this project, we aim to classify different types of anomalies in the human gastrointestinal tract through endoscopic imagery.
The KVASIR dataset was used for this task, which consists of 8,000 annotated images in 8 different classes of anomalies, each class containing 1,000 images.
The classes include : 
dyed-lifted-polyps
normal-cecum, normal-pylorus, normal-z-line, esophagitis, polyps, ulcerative colitis, and dyed-resection-margins.

A deep learning algoritgms with transfer learning was utilized to classify the images into the different anomaly classes.
The deep learning framework Keras was used, along with Numpy and Scikit-learn for numerical processing and machine learning, and Matplotlib for plotting.
